Learn Git and explore!

There are many great ways to learn Git out there 
(eg. https://try.github.io/), but one of the drawbacks
of existing stuff is that they do not really allow
"out-of-the-box exploration". This is an attempt to
allow users to follow a tutorial, getting experience
with the most important commands and best practices,
all while being able to pause *at any time* and say:
"well, what if I want to do this?".  

The way it works is that a bash script will set-up
example repositories, and guide through users through
several real-world scenarios on basic usage.  There are
many lessons, and users can skip to the one they are
interested in.

learn-git.sh  --  The tutorial contains all directions.

learn-git.sh -c  -- Show git command summary (in color!)

learn-git-test.sh  --  A few basic comprehension tests.
